Hello! Welcome to the world.

Hello, my name is Caitlin Shanahan. I am a second year Masters student at UNH and member of Dr. Fairchild's lab. Originally from Maryland, I received my B.S. in Marine Biology from Roger Williams University in May 2017. In spring 2018, I moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to work for Broward County Sea Turtle Conservation Program as a sea turtle specialist. While a member of that program, I worked under a PhD student to help collect samples from and tag (flipper, PIT, and satellite) nesting loggerhead and green sea turtles. I also volunteered for Guy Harvey's Research Institute tagging and collecting samples of the shark population off of south Florida's coastline. I will forever cherish my time and the people that I met in Florida due to this job. 

Since moving to New Hampshire to attend UNH, I have fallen back in love with being outdoors. It turns out that when it is not the temperature of HELL outside, I quite love spending my time outside of the AC. My boyfriend, Mark, and I have taken to hiking weekly. At the moment we are trying to conquer NH's "52 with a View". It is a collection of 52 mountains that have great views. If anything it is just a list with ideas for good hikes. Our pup, Kona, loves hiking probably more than either of us. I have included a picture of Kona and I at the top of one of the 52. He is wearing his little hiking pack - carrying his own water and food to the top cause it slows his pace just a bit. When the snow comes in just a few weeks, I will switch out my hiking boots for ski boots and slide down the mountains rather than  hiking them. UNH is a great school and I am excited about my project, but NH offers so many (more fun) outdoor activities that are more exciting alternatives to struggling with R. Here's to finding motivation!
